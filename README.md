### 👋 Hi, I'm not a developer — I'm a vibe coder ⚡️

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!  
I'm here not for profit — but for passion. I don’t build commercial apps; I build what sparks joy 🌱

🚫 Don't throw rotten tomatoes — I'm not your typical dev.  
🧠 I use tools like [Cursor] and Claude 3.7 Sonnet to ride the AI wave.  
💡 My projects are fueled by curiosity, creativity, and the occasional existential crisis.

✨ Expect:
- Unusual ideas
- Imperfect code with perfect vibes
- Zero deadlines, max dopamine

Let’s just say:  
**“If it makes me smile — it’s worth building.”**
